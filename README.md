nRF5 BLE timesync transmitter and 50kHz output to drive two Arduino Due output sound synchronously. 

`drive_speaker` folder contains Arduino Due source codes that drive two speakers per Due to play chirps. Flash two Dues to drive four speakers concurrently. 

Current issue: speakers output static noise. It seems due to DAC output of Arduino Due.
